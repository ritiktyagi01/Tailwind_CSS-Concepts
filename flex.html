    1. flex-col-reverse: This class arranges the flex items in a column, but in reverse order. The last item in the HTML will appear at the top, and the first item will appear at the bottom.
    2. flex-row-reverse: This class arranges the flex items in a row, but in reverse order. The last item in the HTML will appear on the left, and the first item will appear on the right.
    3. justify-between: This class distributes the flex items evenly along the main axis (      horizontal axis for flex-row and vertical axis for flex-col), with the first item aligned to the start and the last item aligned to the end. The remaining items are spaced evenly in between.
    4. items-center: This class aligns the flex items along the cross axis (vertical axis for flex-row and horizontal axis for flex-col) to the center of the container.
